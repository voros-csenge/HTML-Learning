    <ol>
        <li>Just warm the milk (to 38-40 °C) while adding it</li>
        sugar and yeast. Take it off the heat, stir in the crumbled yeast, then add the melted butter, the grated lemon
        peel, the scraped vanilla seeds, the two egg yolks and the whole egg.
        <li>Sift the flour into a kneading machine, then start the machine with the hook mixer. Meanwhile, add the
            egg-milk mixture. Let the yeast work with the flour a little, salt is only added in the last step. Knead the
            dough thoroughly in the machine, when it is smooth and separates from the wall of the container, cover it
            with foil and let it rise until doubled.</li>
        <li>While the dough is rising, mix the powdered sugar with the ground walnuts in a bowl. Grease a medium-sized
            porcelain baking dish with a little hand-warm butter and sprinkle with a few spoonfuls of the nut mixture so
            that it sticks to the side of the dish.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough, which has risen in the meantime, on a lightly floured surface and bake for approx. Cut 20 g
            dumplings from it. Thoroughly knead the dumplings (knead and knead them with the palm of your hand), then
            put them in a bowl full of milk and let them soak for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>The dough balls soaked in milk are then rolled in the nut-sugar mixture, then the approx. Arrange them in a
            38 x 26 bowl, going row by row. The bowl should be full, but don't put another row of dough on it, and you
            shouldn't put the dumplings very close together, because they will rise a bit and grow. If there are a few
            walnuts left, sprinkle them between the dough balls.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and let the dough rise until almost double. When it has risen nicely, bake it in a preheated
            oven at 170-180 °C until it becomes a nice golden brown, approx. In 30-35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Baking instruction for the English cream</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the milk with the cream, the split vanilla pod and a pinch of salt. Mix the flour with the butter in a
            small bowl and add it to the milk mixture - let it all melt and become homogeneous. Meanwhile, beat the egg
            yolks with the sugar until white. While stirring continuously, slowly pour our warm milk mixture into the
            egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Boil water in a saucepan and over its steam, while stirring continuously, thicken the English cream to 85-86
            °C. When it has reached the desired consistency, immediately filter it into another container so that it
            does not continue to cook in the heat of the pot held over the steam</li>
